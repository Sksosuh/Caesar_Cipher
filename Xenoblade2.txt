[Fog clears as two titans emerge from a vast sea.]

??? [V.O.]
Long ago,
the world was nothing more than an endless sea
cloaked in a boundless sky,
reaching as far as could possibly be imagined.

[The titans begin to fight each other with massive swords. One uses a sword of 
earth and metal, while the other wields a blade of brilliant blue light.]

??? [V.O.]
Then two great titans came into existence.
The Bionis and the Mechonis.

[With its blade of light, the Bionis cuts off the arm of the Mechonis, which 
falls into the sea below. The Mechonis now wielding its sword with one hand, 
the two continue their duel.]

??? [V.O.]
The titans were locked in a timeless battle.

[The Mechonis strikes the Bionis in its side as the blade of the Bionis digs
into the Mechonis.]

??? [V.O.]
Until at last...
Only their lifeless corpses remained.

[The screen stretches as the screen fades to white, then to black.]

??? [V.O.]
Eons have passed.

[Brief flashes of light can be seen, glimpses of a battle which is raging 
through the haze.]
